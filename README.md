# USL_Credit Card Dataset for Customer Segmentation

## Introduction

The Credit Card Dataset is a popular dataset in the field of credit risk analysis and customer segmentation. It contains information about credit card usage by customers and includes features such as credit limit, gender, age, education, and payment history. The dataset has been widely used for clustering analysis to identify patterns in the credit card usage behaviour of customers. Clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering have been applied to the dataset to identify different groups of customers with similar credit card usage patterns or to identify potential defaulters. The dataset has also been used to evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms and to compare the effectiveness of different feature selection methods. Overall, the Credit Card Dataset is a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring the application of clustering techniques to credit card data analysis.
